# All-Space-Missions-since-1957-prediction-
This is a simple project to gain some some insights and to understand some aspects of Various Space missions dataset. Here, firstly I have cleaned the data and then performed some EDA along with some Machine Learning Algorithms.
# About the project
So as we know that every country conducts several space mission in order to gain more information and share that information with other countries in order become powerful, so these mission are very crucial for any country as it requires great resources, funds and time to complete and still there is no certainty for success, so the aim of my project is to consider some factors which may affect the success of any space mission and find any pattern or trend which can help in the success of future missions.
# Prerequisites
This is about learning Pandas, Numpy, and Matplotlib. One is expected to have Basic Python knowledge and know how to use the Jupyter environment. Anaconda has be used as the tool to perporm the coding part. To open the notebook, just run jupyter notebook from the project root directory.
# Visualization
For visuailization we used matplotlib library python along with Tableau software to create dashboards.
